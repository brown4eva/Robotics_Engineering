# Robotics_Engineering
This is our final project for our course module Robotics Engineering. We study on the turtlebot2 and the PhantomX Pincher Robot Arm.

## Things to Note

These instructions below will get you a copy of the project and the necessary documents needed for you to implement our project. 

## Instructions.

*TurtleBot2
1.Read the Technical Report on our repository and also we wiill advised you to read  ROS by example vol.1 &vol.2 for reference
2.After undergoing the above step you must be able to achieve these results or even  do a better one. We trust you could.

*PhantomX Robot Arm
1.Read Technical Survey Report on our reposoritory.
2.After undergoing the above step you must be able to achieve these results or even  do a better one. We trust you could.

### Source Code: nav_test.py

With the navigation test we first run the phython code which allows the Trutlebot 2 to navigate within our Map by getting the intial pose by clicking on 2D post estimate. 
We initiated a different methof by which we first used the the 2D Post estimate to get cordinates within the our map and then after we commented the default co-ordinates and also commented the function which enables the initial pose to be done by the 2D pose Estimate. Our approach is to able the turtlebot to move autonomously regarding the new coordinates that we added in the nav_test.py file without using the tools in RVIz.
